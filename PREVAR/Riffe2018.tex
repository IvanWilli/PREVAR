\parttitle{Background} 
Markov reward methods have been proposed to calculate the variance of state occupancy time based on age-structured prevalence and survivorship.
\parttitle{Objectives} I aim to clarify the assumptions of this approach, give bounds to its reasonableness, and suggest improvements.
\parttitle{Methods} I calculate results for extreme cases to provide bounds, I simulate the variance under simple assumptions, and simulate a more natural inter-individual state distribution.
\parttitle{Results} I show that state occupancy variance for Sullivan-style inputs is not identified, and I show where previously proposed methods fall with respect to reasonable bounds, randomly generated variances, and my own opinion about what a reasonable inter-individual state distribution might look like.
\parttitle{Conclusions} 
The variance of state occupancy time is only identified if a) state life trajectories are directly observed or b) a process model, such as an incidence-based Markov model, is specified. Sullivan-calculations of life expectancy do not imply a single variance, and are therefore insufficient to make statements on inter-individual disparities in state occupancies.

\section*{Sullivan in continuous time}
Let's begin with some familiar notation, $\ell(x)$ denotes lifetable survivorship, with an arbitrary radix, or starting population. If $\ell(0) = 1$ then $\ell(x)$ can be interpreted as a probability of surviving from birth until age $x$. $\pi(x)$ is the prevalence of a given condition (healthiness or unhealthiness, disability) at age $x$, and it falls in the range $[0,1]$, giving it a probability interpretation. The commonly used Sullivan method \citep{sullivan1971single} of calculating healthy life expectancy, $e^H(x)$ is to integrate the product of these two functions.
%
\begin{equation}
e^H(x) = \frac{1}{\ell(x)} \int_x^\omega \ell(t)\pi(t) \mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
%

Replace $\pi$ with its complement to arrive at the complementary expectancy, $e^U(x)$, such that overall life expectancy for this age is $e(x) = e^U(x) + e^H(x)$, a rudimentary composition.

\section*{Two assumptions}
If we would like to know something about the variance of state occupancy in a Sullivan setup, then we must make some assumptions about how the state is distributed over individuals. The Sullivan method does not state which between-individual state distribution underlies prevalence in a given age. If $\pi(x) = 0.5$, shall we assign each individual age $x$ a value of 0.5 a so-called \emph{fixed reward}, or shall we assign half of them a value of 1, and the other half a value of 0, a \emph{Bernoulli reward} \citep{caswell2018matrix}? Or something else entirely? There are infinitely many ways to distribute state $\pi$ among individuals in age $x$ such that the value $\pi(x)$ is maintained. By extension, the inter-individual distribution of total time spent in state $\pi$ is also infinitely variable, which implies that the variance and other moments of implied state occupancy are not uniquely identified. 

Expressing the lifetable as a Markov chain with \emph{rewards} defined as prevalence gives a unique definition for the variance of state occupancy for each of the above assumptions, but it is unclear to me how well-supported these are. Many other reward types are discussed by Caswell \& Zarulli \cite{caswell2018matrix}, and I do not discuss these, nor do I treat the case of multistate populations. Even so, the conclusions reached here will generalize to the case of multistate populations.
