\parttitle{Background} 
Markov reward methods have been proposed to calculate the variance of state occupancy time based on age-structured prevalence and survivorship.
\parttitle{Objectives} I aim to clarify the assumptions of this approach, give bounds to its reasonableness, and suggest improvements.
\parttitle{Methods} I calculate results for extreme cases to provide bounds, I simulate the variance under simple assumptions, and simulate a more natural inter-individual state distribution.
\parttitle{Results} I show that state occupancy variance for Sullivan-style inputs is not identified, and I show where previously proposed methods fall with respect to reasonable bounds, randomly generated variances, and my own opinion about what a reasonable inter-individual state distribution might look like.
\parttitle{Conclusions} 
The variance of state occupancy time is only identified if a) state life trajectories are directly observed or b) a process model, such as an incidence-based Markov model, is specified. Sullivan-calculations of life expectancy do not imply a single variance, and are therefore insufficient to make statements on inter-individual disparities in state occupancies.
